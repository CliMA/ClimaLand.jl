Return latitudes and longitude for the diagnostics of the land model run at a

    make_ocean_mask(nelements)

Make an ocean mask.

# Notes
- ClimaLand simulates only locations where its mask == 1 (based on a threshold
  set in the simulations). Since parameters are not defined over the ocean, this
  can lead to unphysical parameter combinations right at the coastline.
- The interpolated diagnostics are not mask aware; this again means that grid
  points treated as land by the simulation are combined with grid points that
  are not acted on by the simulation (typically set to zero, but possibly
  undefined). Again the result is that grid points on the coastline are not
  guaranteed to be physically realistic.
- Consequently, here we define the mask used to select calibration points using
  a more stringent criterion (essentially, that the grid point in the simulation
  is only comprised of land, and the point in the diagnostic is only comprised
  of land)
