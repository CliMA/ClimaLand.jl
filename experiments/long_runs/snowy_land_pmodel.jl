# # Global run of land model

# The code sets up and runs ClimaLand v1, which
# includes soil, canopy, and snow, on a spherical domain,
# using ERA5 data as forcing. In this simulation, we have
# turned lateral flow off because horizontal boundary conditions and the
# land/sea mask are not yet supported by ClimaCore.

# Simulation Setup
# Number of spatial elements: 101 in horizontal, 15 in vertical
# Soil depth: 50 m
# Simulation duration: 730 d
# Timestep: 450 s
# Timestepper: ARS111
# Fixed number of iterations: 3
# Jacobian update: every new Newton iteration
# Atmos forcing update: every 3 hours
