# # Hydrostatic Equilibrium test for Richards Equation

# This tutorial shows how to use `ClimaLand` code to solve
# Richards equation in a column of soil. We choose boundary
# conditions of zero flux at the top and bottom of the column,
# and then run the simulation long enough to see that the system
# is approaching hydrostatic equilibrium, where the gradient of the
# pressure head is equal and opposite the gradient of the
# gravitational head.

# The equations are:

# ``
# \frac{ ∂ ϑ_l}{∂ t} = ∇ ⋅ K (ϑ_l; ν, ...) ∇h( ϑ_l, z; ν, ...).
# ``

# Here

# ``t`` is the time (s),

# ``z`` is the location in the vertical (m),

# ``K`` is the hydraulic conductivity (m/s),

# ``h`` is the hydraulic head (m),

# ``ϑ_l`` is the augmented volumetric liquid water fraction,

# ``ν, ...`` denotes parameters relating to soil type, such as porosity.


# We will solve this equation in a 1-d domain with ``z ∈ [-5,0]``,
# and with the following boundary and initial conditions:

# ``- K ∇h(t, z = 0) = 0 ẑ ``

# `` -K ∇h(t, z = -5) = 0 ẑ``

# `` ϑ(t = 0, z) = ν-0.001 ``

# `` θ_i(t = 0, z) = 0.0. ``

# where ``\nu`` is the porosity.

# When solving Richards
# equation (not a fully integrated energy and hydrology model), the
# hydraulic conductivity is only a function of liquid moisture content.

# Lastly, our formulation of this equation allows for a continuous solution in both
# saturated and unsaturated areas, following Woodward and Dawson (2000).

# # Preliminary setup

# - Load external packages

import SciMLBase
using Plots
# - Load CliMA packages and ClimaLand modules

using ClimaCore
import ClimaParams as CP
import ClimaTimeSteppers as CTS

using ClimaLand
using ClimaLand.Domains: Column
using ClimaLand.Soil

import ClimaLand
import ClimaLand.Parameters as LP

# - Define the float type desired (`Float64` or `Float32`), and get the parameter set, which holds constants used across CliMA models:
const FT = Float32;
earth_param_set = LP.LandParameters(FT);

# # Set up the soil model

# We want to solve Richards equation alone, without simultaneously
# solving the heat equation. Because of that, we choose a
# [`RichardsModel`](@ref
# ClimaLand.Soil.RichardsModel). Taking a look at the documentation (linked),
# we see that we need to supply parameters, a domain, boundary conditions, and sources.


# First, we define the parameters: porosity `\nu`, K_sat, the van Genuchten parameters
# `vg_α`, `vg_m`, `vg_n`, `θ_r`, and the specific storage value for the soil. Note
# that all values must be given in mks units.
K_sat = FT(0.0443 / (3600 * 100))
S_s = FT(1e-3)
ν = FT(0.495)
vg_α = FT(2.6)
vg_n = FT(2)
hcm = vanGenuchten{FT}(; α = vg_α, n = vg_n);
θ_r = FT(0)
params = Soil.RichardsParameters(;
    ν = ν,
    hydrology_cm = hcm,
    K_sat = K_sat,
    S_s = S_s,
    θ_r = θ_r,
);

# Next, we define the domain. Here, we are considering a 1D domain, discretized using
# finite difference, with coordinates `z`:
zmax = FT(0)
zmin = FT(-5)
nelems = 10
soil_domain = Column(; zlim = (zmin, zmax), nelements = nelems);

# We also need to specify the boundary conditions. The user must
# specify two conditions,  at the top and at the bottom of the domain.
# We currently support two broad types of boundary conditions: boundary
# conditions on the state ϑ_l = ϑ_l_BC (`MoistureStateBC`) or on the
# flux (`WaterFluxBC`, `FreeDrainag`e, or `RichardsAtmosDrivenFluxBC`).
# Flux boundary conditions
# are passed as the (scalar) z-component of the flux `f`, i.e. F⃗ = f ẑ.
# The flux BC `RichardsAtmosDrivenFluxBC` is for driving Richards
# equation with a spatially and temporally varying map of precipitation.
# `FreeDrainage` is an option only at the bottom of the domain.
# Here, we set zero flux boundary conditons.
# WaterFluxBCs require a function of the cache `p` and the simulation time `t`:
surface_flux = Soil.WaterFluxBC((p, t) -> 0.0)
bottom_flux = Soil.WaterFluxBC((p, t) -> 0.0)
boundary_conditions = (; top = surface_flux, bottom = bottom_flux);

# Lastly, in this case we don't have any sources, so we pass an empty tuple:
sources = ();

# Now we can make the model itself. This contains every piece of information needed
# to turn the continuous form of Richards equation into a set of ODEs,
# ready to be passed off to a timestepper.
soil = Soil.RichardsModel{FT}(;
    parameters = params,
    domain = soil_domain,
    boundary_conditions = boundary_conditions,
    sources = sources,
);

# Here we create the explicit and implicit tendencies, which update prognostic
# variable components that are stepped explicitly and implicitly, respectively.
# We also create the function which is used to update our Jacobian.
exp_tendency! = make_exp_tendency(soil);
imp_tendency! = ClimaLand.make_imp_tendency(soil);
jacobian! = ClimaLand.make_jacobian(soil);

# # Set up the simulation
# We can now initialize the prognostic and auxiliary variable vectors, and take
# a peek at what those variables are:
Y, p, coords = initialize(soil);
Y.soil |> propertynames

p.soil |> propertynames

coords |> propertynames

# Note that the variables are nested into `Y` and `p` in a hierarchical way.
# Since we have the vectors (composed of [ClimaCore Fields](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/dev/api/#ClimaCore.Fields.Field) handy, we can now set them to the desired initial
# conditions.
Y.soil.ϑ_l .= FT(0.494);

# We choose the initial and final simulation times:
t0 = Float64(0)
tf = Float64(60 * 60 * 24 * 36);

# We set the cache values corresponding to the initial conditions
# of the state Y:
set_initial_cache! = make_set_initial_cache(soil);
set_initial_cache!(p, Y, t0);

# Next, we turn to timestepping.
# As usual, your timestep depends on the problem you are solving, the accuracy
# of the solution required, and the timestepping algorithm you are using.
dt = Float64(1e3);

# Now, we choose the timestepping algorithm we want to use.
# We'll use the ARS111 algorithm with 1 Newton iteration per timestep;
# you can also specify a convergence criterion and a maximum number
# of Newton iterations.

    ),
);

# Here we set up the information used for our Jacobian.
jac_kwargs =
    (; jac_prototype = ClimaLand.FieldMatrixWithSolver(Y), Wfact = jacobian!);

# And then we can solve the system of equations, using
# [SciMLBase.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl) and
# [ClimaTimeSteppers.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaTimeSteppers.jl).

);
sol = SciMLBase.solve(prob, ode_algo; dt = dt, adaptive = false);


# # Create some plots
# We'll plot the moisture content vs depth in the soil, as well as
# the expected profile of `ϑ_l` in hydrostatic equilibrium.
# For `ϑ_l` values above porosity, the soil is
# saturated, and the pressure head changes from being equal to the matric
# potential to the pressure generated by compression of water and the soil
# matrix. The profile can be solved
# for analytically by (1) solving for the form that `ϑ_l(z)` must take
# in both the saturated and unsaturated zones to satisfy the steady-state
# requirement with zero flux boundary conditions, (2) requiring that
# at the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones, the water content
# equals porosity, and (3) solving for the location of the interface by
# requiring that the integrated water content at the end matches that
# at the beginning (yielding an interface location of `z≈-0.56m`).
