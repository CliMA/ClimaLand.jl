# # Introduction to the Land Bucket Model

# The land bucket model implemented in ClimaLand is based off of
# the models of Manabe (1969)[1], Milly and Shmakin (2002)[2], and the SLIM
# model (Laguë, Bonan, Swann 2019)[3], with small changes, as noted.

# This tutorial explains in brief the core equations and the
# necessary parameters of the bucket model, and shows how to set up a simulation in standalone
# mode. More detail for coupled runs can be
# found in the ClimaCoupler.jl [documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCoupler.jl/dev/) and in the coupled simulation [tutorial](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLand.jl/dev/generated/coupled_bucket/).

# At each coordinate point on the surface, we solve ordinary differential
# equations for the subsurface water storage
# of land (`W`, m), the snow water equivalent multiplied by the snow cover fraction (`σS`, m),
# and the surface water content of land (`Ws`, m).
# We additionally solve a partial differential equation for the land
# temperature as a function of depth (`T`, K). The snow cover fraction
# is given by a heaviside function in the current code.

# In what follows,
# surface fluxes over `soil` generally indicate fluxes
# over non-snow-covered
# regions. The exception
# is the albedo of vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces, for which
# we use the symbol `α_sfc`.

# All equation variables are defined immediately below. We have:

# ``
# \frac{d W}{dt} = -I,
# ``

# ``
# \frac{d Ws}{dt} = -(P_{liq} + σM + (1-σ) E_{soil} - I),
# ``

# ``
# \frac{d σS}{dt} = -(P_{snow} + σE_{snow} - σM),
# ``

# ``
# ρc \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
# ``

# ``
# F_{bot} = 0.0 = -κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}|_{z = z_{bot}}
# ``

# ``
# (1-σ) (R_n+ SHF + LHF)_{soil} + σG_{undersnow} = -κ_{soil} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}|_{z = z_{sfc}}
# ``

# ``
# G_{undersnow} = (R_n+ SHF + LHF)_{snow} - F_{intosnow}
# ``

# ``
# F_{intosnow} = -ρ_l L_{f,0} (P_{snow} + E_{snow}-M)
# ``


# ``
# R_n = -(1-α)*SW↓ -LW↓ + σ_{SB} T_{sfc}^4
# ``

# where the water fluxes are : `I` the infiltration as defined in [1], `P_liq` (m/s) the
# water volume flux of precipitation, `P_snow` (m/s) the water
# volume flux in the form of snow, `(1-σ)E_soil` (m/s) the water volume flux
# in evaporation,
# `σE_snow` the water volume flux in sublimation from snow, and
# `σM` (m/s) the water volume flux in melting of snow. The melt rate is
# defined via the net surface flux when surface temperatures are above freezing.
# All fluxes are defined to be positive if towards the atmosphere
# (cooling land or decreasing water mass in land) and negative if
# towards land (warming land or increasing water mass). Hence
# the melting flux is negative since it warms land, and precipitation
# fluxes are negative since they increase water mass on land.

# For heat fluxes, we have `R_n` the net radiation, `SHF` the sensible
# heat flux, `LHF` the latent heat flux, `G_undersnow` the heat flux into snow-covered soil,
# and `F_intosnow` the heat flux into the snowpack itself. Note that the water balance
# equation for snow is equivalent to the heat balance
# equation, since we neglect the sensible heat contribution and only track the
# latent heat contribution. We neglect the energy in liquid precipitation.

# Finally, we have `α_bareground_func(lat, lon)` the
# (snow-free) surface albedo, `ρc` the volumetric
# heat capacity of the land, `σ_SB` the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,  and `κ_soil` the thermal
# conductivity. The albedo is a linear interpolation between the albedo of surface and
# snow, as decribed in [3]. The surface temperature is taken to be equal to the temperature
# T at the first grid point, assumed to be the same for soil and snow. At present the snow cover fraction is a heaviside function, and only one set
# of surface fluxes is computed per grid point.

# Turbulent surface fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and water vapor
# (`SHF, LHF, E`) are computed using Monin-Obukhov theory; `SW↓` and `LW↓`
# are the downward fluxes in short and long wavelength bands. We use the same
# roughness lengths for snow and soil.
# Note that with the exception of precipitation and downwelling radiation,
# all fluxes are defined
# such that positive is towards the atmosphere.

# As the temperature at the surface of the soil and snow is the same, only the evaporation
# changes between the two surface coverage types. We have

# ``
# E_{soil} =  β(W, W_f) E(q_{sat}(T_{sfc}, ρ_{sfc}; liquid),
# ``

# where β is the factor used in [1] which accounts for the fact that soil does not evaporate at the potential
# rate when it is not saturated. This makes use of the field
# capacity parameter `W_f`.
# We also have

# ``
# E_{snow} = E(q_{sat}(T_{sfc}, ρ_{sfc}; ice).
# ``

# # Simulating a standalone bucket model

# First, we need to import necessary packages. We use [SciMLBase.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl)
# and [ClimaTimeSteppers.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaTimeSteppers.jl) for the timestepping.
import SciMLBase
import ClimaTimeSteppers as CTS

# We use [ClimaCore](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl)
# for setting up the domain/coordinate points. While
# this infrastructure isn't really necessary for standalone simulations,
# adhering to it makes setting up coupled simulations very easy. It also
# is nice to rely on ClimaCore utilities because they have been designed
# in advance for running distributed simulations.
using ClimaCore

# We also use ClimaParams, which strives to ensure a common set of
# parameters across all Clima models, and to make parameter estimation
# more seamless.
import ClimaParams as CP

# We also use Insolation to calculate solar zenith angle and solar insolation.


# Lastly, let's bring in the bucket model types (from ClimaLand) that we
# will need access to.

using ClimaLand.Bucket:
    BucketModel, BucketModelParameters, PrescribedBaregroundAlbedo
using ClimaLand.Domains: coordinates, Column
using ClimaLand:

# We also want to plot the solution
using Plots

# And we need to use the DateTime type to store start dates
using Dates

FT = Float32;

# As mentioned we use ClimaParams for earth parameters that are
# required across models (e.g. the density of water and ice, the latent
# heat of fusion at a reference temperature, etc). The land model requires
# additional parameters as described in the text above. These two sets
# are combined in the object `BucketModelParameters` as follows:
import ClimaLand
import ClimaLand.Parameters as LP
earth_param_set = LP.LandParameters(FT);

# Set up the model domain. At every surface coordinate point, we'll solve
# an ODE for `W` and `Ws`, and for every subsurface point, we solve for `T`.
# In coupled simulations run at the same
# resolution as the atmosphere, the bucket horizontal resolution would match the
# horizontal resolution at the lowest level of the atmosphere model. In general, however, the two
# resolutions do not need to match. Here we just set up something
# simple - a Column.

# a netcdf file with the bareground albedo.

# The PrescribedAtmosphere and PrescribedRadiation need to take in a reference
# time, the date of the start of the simulation. In this tutorial we will
# consider this January 1, 2005.
start_date = DateTime(2005);

# To drive the system in standalone mode,
# the user must provide
# prescribed functions of time for the water volume flux in precipitation,
#  for the net downward shortwave and longwave
# radiative energy fluxes (`SW↓, LW↓`, W/m^2),
# for the atmospheric temperature `T_a`,
# wind speed `u_a` (m/s), specific humidity `q_a`, and air density
# `ρ_a` (kg/m^3) at a reference height `h_a` (m).

# Here we define the model drivers
# Prescribed atmospheric variables

# Precipitation:

# Then, we create the model object, which contains the drivers, parameters,
# domain, and is associated with the correct differential equations
# for the bucket model:
model = BucketModel(
    parameters = bucket_parameters,
    domain = bucket_domain,
    atmosphere = bucket_atmos,

# Note the holder structs for the radiation and atmosphere functions: they
# are named `Prescribed`. In coupled simulations, we would use a different
# type and rely on multiple dispatch to obtain the atmospheric and radiative
# quantitites from the coupler.

# Like all ClimaLand models, we set up the state vector using `initialize`:
Y, p, coords = initialize(model);

# We can inspect the prognostic and auxiliary variables of the model:
ClimaLand.prognostic_vars(model)
Y.bucket |> propertynames
# The auxiliary variables in this case are the surface temperature, the turbulent fluxes, the
# net radiation, and the surface specific humidity.
ClimaLand.auxiliary_vars(model)
p.bucket |> propertynames


# Next is to set initial conditions.
Y.bucket.T .= FT(270);
Y.bucket.W .= FT(0.05);

# We also set the initial values of the cache here:
set_initial_cache! = make_set_initial_cache(model);
set_initial_cache!(p, Y, t0);

# Then to create the entire right hand side (tendency) function for the system
# of ordinary differential equations:
exp_tendency! = make_exp_tendency(model);

# Now we choose our timestepping algorithm.
timestepper = CTS.RK4()

# Then we can set up the simulation and solve it:

    Y,
    (t0, tf),
