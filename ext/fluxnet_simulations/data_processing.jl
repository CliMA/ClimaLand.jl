    get_UTC_datetimes(hour_offset_from_UTC, data, column_name_map; timestamp_name = "TIMESTAMP")

Converts local timestamps from FLUXNET data to UTC timestamps.

Fluxnet as has three timestamps associated with it: TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP_START, and TIMESTAMP_END,
with the first referring to an unspecified timestamp of the data, the second referring to the start
of the averaging period, and the third the end.

For forcing data, we want to get the timestamps at the start and end of each averaging period,
then average them to get the timestamp at the midpoints. This can be done by calling this function
twice, once with `timestamp_name = "TIMESTAMP_START"` and once with `"TIMESTAMP_END"`,
then averaging the results.

For comparison data, we want to get the timestamp at the end of the averaging period (described below).
This can be done by calling this function with `timestamp_name = "TIMESTAMP_END"`.

ClimaLand diagnostics are reduced over a time period (e.g. hourly, daily, monthly), and saved with the
first date following that average period. For example, the hourly average from 11-noon is saved with a
timestamp of noon. To make a true comparison to Fluxnet data, therefore, we must use halfhourly
diagnostics in ClimaLand, and return the UTC time that corresponds to the end of the averaging period in Fluxnet.

# Arguments
- `hour_offset_from_UTC`: The hour offset from UTC for the local timezone
        (may be fractional)
- `data`: The data matrix containing timestamp information
- `column_name_map`: Dictionary mapping variable names to column indices in the data
- `timestamp_name`: The timestamp column name to use
        (options: "TIMESTAMP_START" (default), "TIMESTAMP_END", "TIMESTAMP")

If `error_on_missing` is false, missing variable names will be mapped to `nothing`.

# Arguments

`preprocess_func`, which should be a pointwise function. The
key of the NamedTuple should be the shortname of the corresponding
variable using the shortname of ClimaDiagnostics: `climaland_shortname`.

If the data column
is missing completely, or if the column is present
but the data is missing in each row, an empty NamedTuple
is returned.

In the future, we can explore dropping the missing values to be
consistent with what we do above, but this is consistent with the
current Fluxnet runs.
