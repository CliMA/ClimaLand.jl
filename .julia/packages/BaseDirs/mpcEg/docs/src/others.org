#+title: A Survey of other XDG-y packages

The entire point of this package is to handle locations in a fairly standardised
way. With this in mind, it seems fairly sensible to survey other notable XDG-y
packages and see how them behave. Specifically, we will be looking at the
following:
+ (Go) [[https://github.com/adrg/xdg][xdg]]
+ (Rust) [[https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs][directories-rs]]
+ (Python) [[https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs][platform-dirs]]
+ (Qt) [[https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qstandardpaths.html][QStandardPaths]]
+ [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html][XDG Base Directory Specification]]

[fn:binhome] While =XDG_BIN_HOME= is not yet standard, it seems like the most
likely name to be given to =~/.local/bin= (see [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-specs/-/issues/14][this issue]]), and I think it is
worth having something rather than nothing.

* Discrepancies
** Base directories
*** MacOS
**** User configuration
***** The conflict

=directories-rs= uses =~/Library/Preferences= while all the other implementations
use =~/Library/Application support=.

***** Resolution

Looking at [[https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW11][Table 1.3]] of Apple's Standard Directory Guidelines, it says of
=~/Library/Preferences= that "You should not create files in this directory
yourself. Instead, use the NSUserDefaults class or CFPreferences API to get and
set preference values for your app." (wnich I interpret as "don't touch
directly"), and of =~/Library/Application Support= that "Use this directory to
store all app data files except those associated with the user’s documents".
Given the intended use of this package is to procure the correct locations to
read/write files to, =~/Library/Application Support= is thus the more appropriate
choice.

**** System configuration
***** The conflict

Qt uses =~/Library/Preferences=, while Go XDG uses =~/Library/Preferences=,
=/Library/Application Support=, and =/Library/Preferences=. The other
implementations do not declare a MacOS system configuration directory.

***** Resolution

For the aforementioned reasons with User configuration on MacOS, the =Preferences=
folder does not seem appropriate, which leaves =/Library/Application Support=.

**** User executables
***** The conflict

MacOS does not have a standard directory for user executables.

***** Resolution

Look for the common manually specified "local executable folder" paths
(=~/.local/bin/=, =/opt/local/bin=) on the path, and if none of them are found fall
back on the system executable folder =/usr/local/bin=.

**** Runtime
***** The conflict

MacOS simply has no direct equivalent of the XDG runtime directory. Thus, we
must choose which aspect of the runtime directory we think is more important:
the transient-ness, or the association with the application. Qt and Go XDG pick
the lattter, but Python's =platform-dirs= picks the latter.

***** Resolution

Since in the XDG spec the runtime directory is a collection of all application's
runtime files which is held in-memory, a temporary directory seems to make the
most sense in this regard. However, while the runtime directory's contents are
transient, then might not be able to be safely deleted on a whim, which is one
of the usual assumptions made about the contents of a temporary directory.

There is no clear option here, but I will prioritise avoiding putting fragile
files in a temporary directory, and so we will go with =~/Library/Application
Support=.

*** Windows
**** Roaming vs Local app data
***** The conflict

Across the data and configuration folders, there is general contention around
whether =RoamingAppData= or =AppData= should be used. The difference seems to
relate to DomainController and ActiveDirectory --- simply put data in
=RoamingAppData= will follow the user around, while =AppData= won't. The idea is
that "less essential but potentially large" information goes in =AppData=.

***** Resolution

I think configuration should follow the user around, and if data can be stored
locally because it's not essential, then that's what the cache is for. So,
=RoamingAppData= will be used for everything but State, Cache, and Runtime.

In there is demand in the future, a ~local::Bool~ keyword argument could be added
to support both modes of operaton.

**** Executable files
***** The conflict

Windows doesn't have anywhere that user executable files are supposed to go.

***** Resolution

Like with MacOS, check for locations that users seem to use for this purpose
which are also on the path, namely =~\bin=, =RoamingAppData\bin=, and =AppData\bin=.
If none of these exist, use the current working directory as at least that way
the provided path [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/shell/app-registration#finding-an-application-executable][will be callable]] in the state at the time.

** User directories

No conflicts 🎉.

** Project directories
*** Windows AppData project suffixes
**** The conflict

Some projects just use =AppData\$Project= for the data, config, and cache folders,
however =directories-rs= adds suffixes after the project.

**** Resolution

There's no formally specified structure, and conventions in usage are loose, so
we may as well decide on a more structured approach, and use suffix directories.

** Extra directories
*** A collection of different directories
**** The conflict

Some packages only have one or two Application/Font directories, other have many.

**** Resolution

Since these will primarily be used for searching, it makes sense to include all
valid paths.
