    AbstractSoilHydrologyClosure{FT <: AbstractFloat}

The abstract type of soil hydrology closure, of which
vanGenuchten{FT} and BrooksCorey{FT} are the two supported
concrete types.

To add a new parameterization, methods are required for:
- matric_potential,
- inverse_matric_potential,
- pressure_head,
- dψdϑ,
- hydraulic_conductivity.
