Keyword arguments
=================

- `short_name`: Name used to identify the variable in the output files and in the file
                names. Short but descriptive. `ClimaLand` diagnostics are identified by the
                short name. We follow the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project conventions.

- `long_name`: Name used to identify the variable in the output files.

- `standard_name`: Standard name, as in
                   http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/71/build/cf-standard-name-table.html

- `units`: Physical units of the variable.

- `comments`: More verbose explanation of what the variable is, or comments related to how
              it is defined or computed.

- `compute!`: Function that compute the diagnostic variable from the state.
                             It has to take two arguments: the `integrator`, and a
                             pre-allocated area of memory where to write the result of the
                             computation. If no pre-allocated area is available, a new
                             one will be allocated. To avoid extra allocations, this
                             function should perform the calculation in-place (i.e., using
                             `.=`).
