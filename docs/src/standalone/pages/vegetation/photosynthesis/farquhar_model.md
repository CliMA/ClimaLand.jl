# Farquhar Model
This section breaks down the Farquhar model that describes the biochemical process of photosynthesis in plants as environmental conditions change.

The biochemical processes within a leaf determine the rate of photosynthesis, particularly the diffusion of CO$_2$ into the leaf, the assimilation of CO$_2$ during photosynthesis, and the transpiration of water vapor. It takes into account factors such as light intensity, temperature, and CO$_2$ concentration to estimate the rate at which plants convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.

The net assimilation by a leaf (An) is calculated based on the biochemistry of C3 and C4 photosynthesis
to determine potential (unstressed by water availability) leaf-level photosynthesis. This is calculated in terms of two potentially-limiting rates:
the Rubisco-limited rate and light-limited rate.

## Rubisco limited rate

```math
\begin{equation}
a_1(T, c_a, VPD) =
\begin{cases}
      V_{cmax}(T)  \frac{(c_i(T, c_a, VPD) - \Gamma^*(T))}{(c_i(T, c_a, VPD) + K_c(T)*(1+o_i/K_o(T)))} & \text{for C3}\\
      V_{cmax}(T) & \text{for C4}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
```

The dependence on the atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration $c_a$ (mol/mol) and vapor pressure deficit $VPD$ arise in the expression for $c_i$,
```math
\begin{align}
    c_i(T, c_a, VPD) = \max{(c_a(1-1/m(VPD)), \Gamma^*(T)}),
\end{align}
```
where and $m$ is the Medlyn factor (see Stomatal Conductance).

We also have
```math
    \Gamma^*(T) = \Gamma^*_{25}\exp\left(\Delta H_{\Gamma^*}\frac{T - T_o}{T_o R T}\right),
```

where $\Delta H_{\Gamma^*}$ is the activation energy per mol for $\Gamma^*$.

## Light limited rate

```math
\begin{equation}
a_2 =
\begin{cases}
      J(T, PAR) (c_i - \Gamma^*)/4(c_i + 2  \Gamma^*) & \text{for C3}\\
      J(T, PAR) & \text{for C4}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
```

where J is the rate of electron transport, which has units of mol photon per m$^2$ per s. It depends on $PAR$ via $APAR$, as described below, and on $T$ via the dependence on $J_{max}$.

J is given by the root of the equation
```math
\begin{align}
    \theta_j J^2 - (I + J_{max}) J + I J_{max} &= 0 \nonumber \\
    I &= \frac{\phi}{2} (APAR) \nonumber \\
    J_{max}(T) &= V_{cmax}(T)\times e \exp\left(\Delta H_{J_{max}}\frac{T - T_o}{T_o R T}\right),\nonumber \\
J(T, PAR) &= \frac{(I + J_{max} - \sqrt{(I + J_{max})^2 - 4\theta_j I \times J_{max}}}{2\theta_j},
\end{align}
```
where $\phi = 0.6$ and $\theta_j = 0.9$ are the quantum yield of photosystem II and a curvature function (Bonan's book), and $\Delta H_{J_{max}}$ is the energy of activation of $J_{max}$.

The total net carbon assimilation (A$_n$, mol CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is given by the weighted sum of C3 and C4 net carbon assimilation fractions following:
```math
\begin{align}
A_n(T, PAR, VPD, c_a) = \text{max}(0, \text{min}(a_1 \beta, a_2) - R_d)
\end{align}
```

where $\beta$ is the moisture stress factor which is related to the mean soil moisture concentration in the root zone and R$_d$ is the leaf dark respiration calculated as
```math
\begin{align}
    R_{d,25}(\psi_l) &= f V_{cmax,25}\beta(\psi_l), \nonumber \\
    R_d (T, \psi_l) & = R_{d,25}(\psi_l)\exp\left(\Delta H_{R_{d}}\frac{T - T_o}{T_o R T}\right),
\end{align}
```

where $f = 0.015$ is a constant, $\Delta H_{R_d}$ is the energy of activation for $R_d$, and finally
Vcmax is calculated as
```math
\begin{equation}
V_{cmax}(T) = V_{cmax,25} \exp\left(\Delta H_{Vcmax}\frac{T - T_o}{T_o R T}\right)\\
\end{equation}
```
with $V_{cmax,25}$ is a parameter (Vcmax at the reference temperature 25 C), and $\Delta H_{Vcmax} = 65,330 J/mol$.

The moisture stress factor is related to the leaf water potential $\psi_l$ as
```math
\begin{align}
    \beta = \frac{1+ \exp{(s_c \psi_c)}}{1+ \exp{(s_c(\psi_c - \psi_l))}},
\end{align}
```
where $s_c = 4$MPa$^{-1}$, $\psi_c = -2$MPa, and $\psi_l$ is the leaf water potential computed by the plant hydraulics model.

GPP is the total canopy photosynthesis calculated as the integral of leaf-level photosynthesis over the entire canopy leaf area index:
```math
\begin{align}
GPP(T, PAR, c_a, VPD, \theta_s) = A_n  (1 - \exp(-K LAI \Omega))/K.
\end{align}
```
This is not currently needed by other components, but is used for offline validation of the model.

We need to supply the following parameters and ‚Äúdrivers"

- ``K_{c,25}`` and $K_{o,25}$, $V_{cmax, 25}$, $\Gamma^*_{25},\phi$, $\theta_j$, $o_i$, $s_c$, $\psi_c$
- ``\psi_l``, to compute $\beta$
- Temperature $T$, $PAR$, $c_a$, VPD, $\theta_s$.
