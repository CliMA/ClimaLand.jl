# The `AbstractModel` framework allows users to define land
# component models (e.g. for snow, soil, vegetation, carbon...)
# which can be run in standalone mode, or as part of a land
# surface model with many components. In order to achieve this
# flexibility, we require a standard interface, which is what
# `AbstractModel`s provide. The interface is designed to work
# with an external package for the time-stepping of
# ODEs, `ClimaTimesteppers.jl`,
# with `ClimaCore.jl`, for the spatial discretization of
# PDEs, and with `ClimaLand.jl`, for designing and
# running multi-component land surface models. For a developer of a new
# land model component, using `AbstractModel`s as shown
# below is the first step towards building a model which
# can be run in standalone or with other components in an
# integrated land surface model.


# This tutorial introduces some of the functionality of the
# `AbstractModel` interface functions and types. We demonstrate
# how to use a `Model <: AbstractModel` structure to define
# a set of equations, and explain a few core methods
# which must be defined for your `Model` type in order to
# run a simulation.

# # General setup
# We assume you are solving a system of the form
# of a set of PDEs or ODEs. Additional algebraic equations
# can be accomodated as well, but only in addition to
# variables advanced using differential equations.

# Spatially discretized PDEs reduce to a system of ODEs,
# so we can assume an ODE system in what follows without a
# loss of generality. When using `AbstractModel`s,
# you should use
# `ClimaCore` to discretize your PDE, as applicable.


# Your model defines a system of equations of the following form:

# ``
# \frac{d \vec{Y}}{d t} = \vec{f}(\vec{Y}, \vec{x}, t; \mbox{params} \ldots)
# ``

# The variables that are stepped forward
# via a differential equation are referred to as prognostic variables, and
# are stored in `` \vec{Y} ``. Generically, we will speak of the
# functions `` \vec{f} `` as tendencies; these can be
# functions of the prognostic state, of space `` \vec{x} ``, and of time
# `` t ``, as well as of other parameters. Note that quantities such as
# boundary conditions, source terms, etc, will appear within these
# tendency functions

# # The cache ("auxiliary variables")

# There are typically quantities, which depend on the state vector `` \vec{Y} ``,
# location, time, and other parameters, which are expensive to compute,
# needed multiple times in the tendency computation, or require "a lot" of  memory to
# store (e.g., most variables in global runs). Allocating memory "on-the-fly" is
# typically time-consuming.  In these cases, it is far better
# to compute a quantity once and store in a variable where memory has been pre-allocated.
# The location where memory is allocated is called the model cache.

# Denoting the cache as `` \vec{p} ``,
# your equations may be rewritten as:

# ``
# \frac{d \vec{Y}}{d t} = \vec{f}(\vec{Y}, \vec{p}, \vec{x}, t; \mbox{params} \ldots)
# ``

# ``
# \vec{p}(\vec{x}, t) = \vec{g}(\vec{Y}, \vec{x}, t; \mbox{params} \ldots)
# ``

# The variables `` \vec{p} `` at the current timestep are functions of the prognostic
# state, space,
# time, and parameters. These variables are referred to as auxiliary variables
# (or cache variables). **Their main purpose is for storing the value of a quantity
# in a pre-allocated spot in memory, to avoid computing something expensive many times
# per time-step, or to avoid allocating memory each timestep. From a mathematical
# point of view, they represent intermediate quantities computed in each tendency.**
# A model purely consisting of algebraic equations, with no prognostic variables,
# is not supported (`` \vec{Y} `` cannot be zero dimensional).

# In order to define this set of equations, in a manner which is consistent
# with the `AbstractModel` interface (used by `ClimaLand.jl`) and
# time-stepping algorithms (`OrdinaryDiffEq.jl` for the present),
# the following must be provided.

# # The Model

# All `ClimaLand` component models are concrete instances of `AbstractModel`s. The reason
# for grouping them in such a way is because they all have shared required
# functionality, as we will see, and can make use of common default behavior.

# The model structure holds all
# of the information needed to create the full right hand side function, including
# parameters (which can be functions of space and time), boundary conditions, and
# physical equations.

# The purpose of our `AbstractModel` interface is that it allows you to run land
# component models in
# standalone mode and in an LSM mode without a change in interface. 

# As a simple demonstration of use, we'll build a model now which solves
# Richards Equation assuming a prescribed flux at the surface,
# and zero flux at the bottom of the column.

# Note that some model equations are stiff and require a very small timestep
# if stepped explicitly in time. Some model equations are amenable to "imex"
# timestepping, where some tendency functions are stepped implicitly,
# and some are stepped explicitly. Tagging a tendency function as "explicit"
# or "implicit" hardcodes something about the timestepping, and as such,
# conflates the idea of the model (which defines the equations) and the independent
# idea of a simulation (which solves the equations). However, we decided we did not need
# to support the flexibility of solving any set of equations in any way, as we
# are focused on land surface modeling in particular.
# In this example, we will tag the tendency as
# an explicitly time-stepped tendency. A follow-on tutorial will explain
# how to define an implicit tendency and tendency Jacobian. 

# Let's first import some needed packages.

# A couple of notes: the vector `` \vec{dY} `` contains the evaluation of the tendency function
# for each variable in `` \vec{Y} ``. It is updated in place (so no extra allocations are needed). Note that
# Y is not a simple array. It is a `ClimaCore` `FieldVector`, which allow us to impose some
# organizational structure on the state while still behaving like arrays in some ways.
# We use the symbol returned by `name(model)` to create the naming hierarchy in `Y`, `dY`, `p`. This 
# is useful for multi-component models.

# The arguments of `compute_exp_tendency!` are generic for any time-stepping algorithm.
# The `compute_exp_tendency!`
# function is only created once. If there are time-varying forcing terms appearing, for example, the
# forcing functions must be stored in `model` and passed in that way.

# # The prognostic state vector `` \vec{Y} `` and cache `` \vec{p} ``

# We have given the state vector `` \vec{Y} `` a particular structure, and don't expect the user
# to build this themselves.
# In order to have the structure `Y` (and `p`) correctly created, the model developer needs to define
# the names of the prognostic and auxiliary variables, as well as their types (often a floating point
# scalar), and where in the domain they are defined. For example, the volumetric water content
# is a scalar (type FT), with name θ, and it is defined throughout the subsurface of the domain.

# The default tendency function in ClimaLand for any AbstractModel carries out the following:

# ```julia
# function make_exp_tendency(model::AbstractModel)
#     update_aux! = make_update_aux(model)
#     update_boundary_fluxes! = make_update_boundary_fluxes(model)
#     compute_exp_tendency! = make_compute_exp_tendency(model)
#     function exp_tendency!(dY,Y,p,t)
#         update_aux!(p,Y,t)
#         update_boundary_fluxes!(p,Y,t)
#         compute_exp_tendency!(dY,Y,p,t)
#     end
#     return exp_tendency!
# end;
# ```

# Therefore, each time we need the tendency, we first update auxiliary variables, then update boundary
# fluxes, and then compute the tendency itself.

# Why do we do this? It would be straightforward, and arguably a lot simpler,
# to update the cache `p` within `compute_exp_tendency!`itself.
# The reason why we introduce these other functions is because we want to be able to
# combine standalone "component" models, like this one, with others, to create
# land surface models. For example, if we would like to run a land surface model with
# the soil and the canopy, the canopy auxiliary variables (e.g. interception of water
# and snow, transmitted radiation) affect the boundary fluxes of the soil.
# In this case, we must update auxiliary variables for all components, before computing
# boundary conditions and tendency functions.
# Please see the (LSM tutorial) for further explanation.

# More complex cases might require the evaluation of external data. For this, use the
# `TimeVaryingInput` interface. You can wrap functions, 1D/2D data in `TimeVaryingInput` to
# obtain an object that know how to evaluate that data on the model time (e.g., by
# performing linear interpolation). Then, in your model, you can just call
# `evaluate!(destination, itp, time)` to evaluate the itp on the given `time` and write the
# result to `dest` (typically a `Field`). With this common interface, you do not have to
# worry about the detail of the underlying data.
