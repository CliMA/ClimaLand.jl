# # Introduction to the Canopy Model

# This tutorial shows how to instantiate and run a simulation of the
# canopy biophysics model in ClimaLand. A
# [`CanopyModel`](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLand.jl/dev/APIs/canopy/Canopy/#Canopy-Model-Structs)
# including all component
# models is initialized, then an example simulation is run. The initial conditions,
# atmospheric and radiative flux conditions, and canopy properties are set up
# to match those observed at the US-MOz flux tower, a flux tower located within
# an oak-hickory forest in Ozark, Missouri, USA. See [Wang et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6741-2021)
# for details on the site and canopy parameters.

# The canopy biophysics model in ClimaLand combines a photosynthesis model with a
# canopy radiative transfer scheme, plant hydraulics model, and stomatal
# conductance model, placing them under either prescribed or simulated (as in a
# full Earth System Model) atmospheric and radiative flux conditions.

# ClimaLand supports either Beer-Lambert law or a Two-Stream model for radiative
# transfer. For this tutorial, we will use the Beer-Lambert law,
# in which the intensity of light absorbed is a negative exponential function of
# depth in the canopy and an exinction coefficient determined by optical depth.

# The model of photosynthesis in Clima Land is the Farquar Model in which GPP is
# calculated based on C3 and C4 photosynthesis, which determines potential
# leaf-level photosynthesis.

# The plant hydraulics model in ClimaLand solves for the water content within
# bulk root-stem-canopy system using Richards equation discretized into an
# arbitrary number of layers. The water content is related to the water
# potential using a retention curve relationship, and the water potential is
# used to simulate the effect moisture stress has on transpiration and GPP.

# # Preliminary Setup

# Load External Packages:

import SciMLBase
using Plots
using Statistics
using Dates
using Insolation

# Load CliMA Packages and ClimaLand Modules:

using ClimaCore
import ClimaParams as CP
import ClimaTimeSteppers as CTS
using StaticArrays
using ClimaLand
using ClimaLand.Domains: Point
using ClimaLand.Canopy
using ClimaLand.Canopy.PlantHydraulics
import ClimaLand
import ClimaLand.Parameters as LP

# Define the floating point precision desired (64 or 32 bit), and get the
# parameter set holding constants used across CliMA Models:

const FT = Float32;
earth_param_set = LP.LandParameters(FT);

# # Setup the Canopy Model

# We want to simulate a vegetative canopy in standalone mode, without coupling
# the canopy to atmospheric or soil physics models, so we choose a
# [`CanopyModel`](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLand.jl/dev/APIs/canopy/Canopy/#Canopy-Model-Structs).
# From the linked
# documentation, we can see that we need to provide shared parameters, a domain,
# a radiative transfer model, photosynthesis model, plant hydraulics model,
# stomatal conductance model, and atmospheric and radiative flux conditions
# which may be either prescribed or simulated.

# First, define the parameters of the model domain. These values are needed
# by some of the component models. Here we are performing a 1-dimensional
# simulation in a `Point` domain and will use
# single stem and leaf compartments, but for 2D simulations, the parameters of
# the [`domain`](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLand.jl/dev/APIs/shared_utilities/#Domains)
# would change.

# - We will be using prescribed atmospheric and radiative drivers from the

# read in the observed LAI and let that vary in time in a prescribed manner.
